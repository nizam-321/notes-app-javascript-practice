# 🗒️ Notes App — JavaScript Practice Project

This is a simple **Notes App** that I built while practicing JavaScript.  
It helped me get better at:

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Using localStorage
- Creating and updating elements with JavaScript

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this project was to **practice**:
- Handling button clicks and user input
- Adding and removing elements dynamically
- Saving data in the browser using `localStorage`
- Working with functions, parameters, and the DOM

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- User writes a note in the textarea.
- On clicking the **"Add Note"** button, the note is added below.
- Notes are saved in `localStorage` and stay even after refreshing.
- Each note has a ❌ delete button to remove it.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- **Bootstrap 5** (for quick styling and responsive layout)

---

## 💡 What I Practiced in This Project

- `document.getElementById()`, `createElement()`, and `appendChild()`
- `addEventListener()` to handle events
- Saving and retrieving from `localStorage`
- Filtering and updating arrays
- Writing clean and readable code
- Using Bootstrap utility classes like:
  - `container`, `d-flex`, `justify-content-center`, `vh-100`
  - `form-control`, `btn`, `btn-success`, `shadow`, `rounded`
